Here’s a very detailed step-by-step guide to create and run a JMeter script with multiple thread groups, each using its own CSV file for login data. We'll also include how to run everything from the command line.

Overview
We’ll set up:

3 Thread Groups (for 3 user journeys)

3 CSV Data Set Configs (one per thread group, each with its own login data)

Run the JMeter script using the command line

Step 1: Prepare Your CSV Files
Create three CSV files for login credentials.

Example:

logins1.csv:

username,password
user1a,pass1a
user1b,pass1b
user1c,pass1c
logins2.csv:

username,password
user2a,pass2a
user2b,pass2b
user2c,pass2c
logins3.csv:

username,password
user3a,pass3a
user3b,pass3b
user3c,pass3c
Place them in a known folder like:

C:\JMeterScripts\data\
Step 2: Create JMeter Test Plan
Open JMeter GUI
Launch Apache JMeter.

Right-click Test Plan > Add > Threads (Users) > Thread Group
Name it: Journey1_ThreadGroup

Set:

Number of Threads (users): 3

Loop Count: 1

Step 3: Add CSV Data Set Config (for Journey 1)
Right-click Journey1_ThreadGroup > Add > Config Element > CSV Data Set Config

Fill:

Filename: C:/JMeterScripts/data/logins1.csv

Variable Names: username,password (must match the header of your CSV or leave empty if CSV has headers)

Delimiter: ,

Recycle on EOF: False

Stop thread on EOF: True

Sharing Mode: Current thread

Step 4: Add HTTP Sampler (or Logic for Journey 1)
Right-click Journey1_ThreadGroup > Add > Sampler > HTTP Request

Use ${username} and ${password} as parameter values or body as needed.

Step 5: Duplicate for Journey 2 and Journey 3
Repeat Steps 2–4:

Thread Group 2: Journey2_ThreadGroup, use logins2.csv

Thread Group 3: Journey3_ThreadGroup, use logins3.csv

Each thread group should use its own CSV Data Set Config with the appropriate file and variables.

Step 6: Save the Test Plan
Save your test plan as:

C:\JMeterScripts\multi_thread_test.jmx
Step 7: Run Test Plan from Command Line
Open Command Prompt:

cd C:\apache-jmeter-5.6.3\bin
Run the test plan:

jmeter -n -t C:\JMeterScripts\multi_thread_test.jmx -l C:\JMeterScripts\results\results.jtl
-n = non-GUI mode

-t = path to .jmx file

-l = log result file (.jtl format)

Step 8: View the Results
You can view the .jtl file in JMeter or convert it to HTML:

jmeter -g C:\JMeterScripts\results\results.jtl -o C:\JMeterScripts\results\html_report
Then open index.html in a browser.

Tips
Make sure your paths have no spaces or use double quotes.

Always verify CSV file paths are correct for each thread group.

If using login sessions (cookies, tokens), ensure each thread group handles them separately.

Let me know if you'd like a sample .jmx file or help generating one automatically.

And threads in command total 100 across all 3 
ChatGPT said:
Great — you want a total of 100 threads (virtual users) across all 3 thread groups in your JMeter test.

Here’s how to set that up in detail:

Step-by-Step: Allocate Threads Across 3 Thread Groups
You can divide the 100 threads however you like. Common options:

Option 1: Equal Distribution (33/33/34)
Journey1_ThreadGroup: 33 threads

Journey2_ThreadGroup: 33 threads

Journey3_ThreadGroup: 34 threads

Option 2: Custom Distribution
Example:

Journey1 = 50

Journey2 = 30

Journey3 = 20

How to Set Thread Count in Each Thread Group
For each Thread Group:

Click on the Thread Group (Journey1_ThreadGroup, etc.)

Set:

Number of Threads (users): as per your plan

Loop Count: usually 1 unless you want to repeat the steps multiple times per user

Update CSV Files Accordingly
Each CSV file should have at least as many rows as the number of threads in its thread group if you're not recycling the data.

For example:

If Journey1 has 50 threads, logins1.csv should have 50 rows (or more).

Otherwise, set Recycle on EOF: True in CSV Data Set Config to reuse credentials.

No Need to Specify Thread Count in CMD
Thread count is defined in the .jmx file, so you don’t need to pass it in the command.

Command remains:

jmeter -n -t C:\JMeterScripts\multi_thread_test.jmx -l C:\JMeterScripts\results\results.jtl
Optional: Use Properties for Dynamic Thread Count
You could parameterize the thread count using variables (e.g., ${__P(users1,33)}) in the JMX, and then run like:

jmeter -n -t C:\JMeterScripts\multi_thread_test.jmx -l C:\JMeterScripts\results\results.jtl -Jusers1=33 -Jusers2=33 -Jusers3=34
But this requires editing your thread groups to use those property values.

Summary
Thread Group	Threads (users)	CSV File
Journey1_ThreadGroup	33	logins1.csv
Journey2_ThreadGroup	33	logins2.csv
Journey3_ThreadGroup	34	logins3.csv
Total Threads: 100

You said:
Jthreads should be usable in command for all 3
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — you want to control the thread counts for each of the 3 thread groups via command-line parameters using custom properties like -Jthreads1=..., -Jthreads2=..., etc. This is fully possible in JMeter using property variables (__P).

Here’s your step-by-step guide to do that:

Step 1: Modify Each Thread Group to Use Property-Based Thread Counts
For each Thread Group:

Example for Journey1_ThreadGroup:
Select Journey1_ThreadGroup

Set Number of Threads (users) to:

${__P(threads1,10)}
This means:

It will use the command-line property threads1

Default to 10 if the property is not passed

Repeat for the other groups:

Journey2_ThreadGroup:
${__P(threads2,10)}
Journey3_ThreadGroup:
${__P(threads3,10)}
You can similarly parameterize other things like ramp-up time if needed.

Step 2: Save the JMX File
Save your test as:

C:\JMeterScripts\multi_thread_test.jmx
Step 3: Run from Command Line with All 3 Thread Counts
Now run the test from CMD with 100 total threads like this:

jmeter -n -t C:\JMeterScripts\multi_thread_test.jmx -l C:\JMeterScripts\results\results.jtl -Jthreads1=33 -Jthreads2=33 -Jthreads3=34
Optional: Ramp-Up Time and Loop Count
You can also parameterize:

Ramp-Up Time: -Jramp1=10

Loop Count: -Jloops1=1

In the GUI:

Set Loop Count as:

${__P(loops1,1)}
Then run like:

jmeter -n -t multi_thread_test.jmx -l results.jtl -Jthreads1=50 -Jramp1=10 -Jloops1=2 ...
Recap
Thread Group	JMX Threads Value	CMD Flag
Journey1	${__P(threads1,10)}	-Jthreads1=33
Journey2	${__P(threads2,10)}	-Jthreads2=33
Journey3	${__P(threads3,10)}	-Jthreads3=34
Total threads: 100
Controlled entirely via command-line — no need to edit the JMX file again.
